# Problem Euler n°2
The subject is :
*Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …**
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*

## My Solution
Not many things to do here. My solution is quite verbose, but I thought that using built-in functions over built-in functions would be too harsh to read.
I separated the problem in three steps :

 1. Generating the Fibonacci sequence, and stop before **x**. Here,
    **x** is 4.000.000.
 2. Filtering the generated list by getting only the even numbers.
 3. Apply a sum function on the filtered list.

### There is a way to do it in fewer steps.
By generating the list already without odd numbers.
For that, I would create two lists at the moment of the generation :

The first list would be the complete one and will gather every Fibonacci number.
The second list would only take even numbers that are generated.
When generating each number, you would put them into this first list, and, if they are even, put them in the second too.
That would help to get rid off the complete filtering step.
